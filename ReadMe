Hand Gesture Recognition System
Overview

Hand gestures are an intuitive and natural way for humans to communicate. This project utilizes MediaPipe and OpenCV to develop a real-time hand gesture recognition system. By detecting gestures such as "THUMBS UP," "CLOSED FIST," "OPEN FIST," and "PEACE", the system enables applications in virtual reality, assistive technology, and beyond.
Features

    Real-time Hand Tracking using MediaPipe

    Gesture Recognition for predefined gestures

    OpenCV Integration for image processing

    Highly Efficient & Lightweight suitable for real-time applications

Technologies Used

    Python

    MediaPipe (for hand tracking)

    OpenCV (for image processing)

    NumPy (for mathematical operations)

Installation

Ensure you have Python installed (recommended: Python 3.8+). Then, install the necessary dependencies:


pip install mediapipe opencv-python numpy


           How It Works

    The system captures live video feed from a webcam.

    MediaPipe's Hand Tracking module detects hand landmarks.

    Key landmarks are extracted and analyzed to recognize predefined gestures.

    OpenCV displays the result in real-time.
